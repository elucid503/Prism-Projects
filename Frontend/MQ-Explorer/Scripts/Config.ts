    "When choosing a career path,": `There are inevitably many career paths available to anyone. It may feel, at times, that the presence of an opportunity is random. In such a case, it will be important to return to this answer. While not a unique guide, ensuring that a career path is chosen with care and consideration can be attributed to properly understanding and following certain "moral obligations" which will be discussed further.`,

    "I'm morally obligated": `Important to both the question and response are "moral obligations". Moral obligations are not the same as legal obligations. None of this is required. It is worthwhile to remind ourselves that choosing a justifiable career path is a <i>choice</i>. This choice should be treated as an important one — made with care. There are many sources of information available to help facilitate discernment on this choice. As inspected upon in the ${Templates.References.WhatIsGoingOn}, a framework to make this aforementioned choice is not simple, and must require deep understanding of precedent and context using Moral Sources.`,

    "to channel my technical talents": `This response is made specifically for those who are in a technical field. This is not to say, however, that this is not applicable to those in non-technical fields. Furthermore, the introduction of the word "channel" is important here. Reading this response is not a passive act. This response only works for those who are willing to look deeply into not only their own lives, but the lives of those around them. To do this, we must engage in Structural Social Analysis and consider our own social location, independent of the communities which may impact our choices. Each and every person has talent, however that talent is only more evident the more carefully it is used.`,

    "into work": `While initially this may seem like a simple phrase, it is paramount for understanding the impact and structure of this response. Here, we see that what was previously discussed takes its presence in reality through one's work. The consequences of one's work are very real, and can be seen in the world around us. Furthermore, this phrase is transitory, introducing the rest of the response. This is because "It's not what you do, but how you do it". While choosing a morally justifiable career is important, there may be cases where you will not be able to do so. This was discussed heavily in both ${Templates.References.WhatIsGoingOn} and ${Templates.References.WhatShouldBeDone}. In that case, it is important to remember that the work you do is not the only thing that matters. The way you do such work can be equally important. <i>This</i> is why the rest of the response is structured as it is.`,

    "that transparently addresses": `In ${Templates.References.WhatIsGoingOn}, the impact of transparency on this question is discussed using Ogletree's initially unrelated commentary on Economics. Transparency is important in any field, and we can extrapolate it to any technical field as well. A simple — yet naive — imperative is that if you are not able to be transparent about your work, then you should not be doing it. While serving as a good rule of thumb, this imperative is also naive, as it is not definitive. It is further discussed in ${Templates.References.WhatIsGoingOn} that companies should not be inherently trusted. If a solution to work which is morally unjustifiable is to disobey orders, transparency may not be possible. The greatest good must therefore be done, transitively extending our response to contain a Utilitarian interpretation.`,

    "genuine social needs,": `Catholic Social Teaching plays a large role in this phrase. Not only should one attempt to find and engage in work which is justifiable, but this response aptly rewards those who attempt to go beyond this — seeking work which gives back. This is a large part of the response, and is not to be taken lightly. The work you do should not only be justifiable, but it should also be rewarding. Being capable to follow this phrase and be entirely dedicated to it <i>without contradiction</i> indicates a strong choice which is very justifiable. The contrapositive also holds. If a job is not rewarding and contains many contradictions to other segments of this response, it is likely that it is not justifiable.`,

    "shares its rewards fairly,": `A Utilitarian would argue that this phrase is the most important part of the response. As mentioned thoroughly in ${Templates.References.WhatShouldBeDone}, Utilitarianism is a very difficult and somewhat limiting ethical theory to follow and adhere to completely. This response shares some Utilitarian logic, however it should, by and large, <i>never</i> be used as a definitive guide. Utilitarianism is a proceduralist theory, and therefore does not consider context, which many other phrases of this question require. Therefore, to only follow Utilitarian logic and only consider this phrase, an interpretation of this response would be dangerously misguided.`,

    "anticipates potential misuse,": `This is where Hobbesian logic shows itself. The world and the people in it are not perfect, and there are many who will attempt to misuse, abuse or even deface one's work. The work being done must be able to not only withstand this, but be created with a potential likelihood of this in mind. There is a limit, however, between being cautious and being overcautious to the extent of never actually executing the best of ideas. Here, we would be well advised to follow Virtue Theory, where the mean between being cautious and overcautious about the potential of misuse of one's work can be found in properly considering <i>all</i> possibilities, and acting rationally upon them. This is, unfortunately, a very difficult balance to strike, which can thankfully be aided by considering other phrases within the response.`,

    "and forms safeguards": `It would be rather unfortunate if there was no way of defending one's work against those who would misuse it. In the tech field specifically, there are many ways to do this. Some examples include using encryption on requests, rate limiting users, and ensuring that the best security practices are followed. To reference a preceding phrase, this is a <i>moral obligation</i> of the developer. Obtaining and properly following one's moral obligations is a virtue. By extension, a vice would be to <i>only</i> consider a specific moral responsibility. Just because your work is secure does not mean it is justifiable. Similarly, just because your work is justifiable does not mean it is secure. This phrase and response lean heavily upon reflexive logic, as it may be helpful to cover different edge cases.`,

    "to prevent foreseeable harm.": `Finally, we end the response with a phrase which generalizes it. A moral responsibility which <i>everyone</i> shares is to "prevent foreseeable harm". Drawing on Utilitarian views, it may not be possible to prevent <i>all</i> harm. Considering a Hobbesian perspective, it may not be obvious how one's work will be harmful until it stands the test of society. Finally, considering a Virtuous perspective, it may be harmful to devote all of one's time on a singular facet of preventing harm, as others would be left unchecked. All approaches are equally important. Unfortunately, it is difficult to consider each one and balance them. While this response introduces the course of action one may take to ensure that the job they choose is justifiable, as well as the work is being done in a justifiable manner, it is not unique to everyone. Appropriate discernment requires appropriate input and consideration of every part of this response.`,
